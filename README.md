# Duke Plus Data Science Program

## Project goal
Identified the drivers of the risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) dataset.

## Details
1. Conducted data pre-processing including transformations, imputation, deduplication, and construction of survival labels.
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analyses using paired t-test and factor analysis to quantify univariate associations and identify underlying structures of the data.
3. Trained the Lasso-Cox Proportional Hazards model and XGBoost-Accelerated Failure Time model to measure the contributions of factors towards increasing or decreasing risk and to model complex feature interactions.

## Software
R - 4.2.2
