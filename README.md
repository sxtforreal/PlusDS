# Duke Plus Data Science Program

## Project goal
Identified the drivers of the risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) dataset.

## Details
•	Conducted data pre-processing including transformations, imputation, deduplication, and construction of survival labels
•	Quantified univariate associations between features and endpoints through t-test analyses
•	Performed factor analysis to uncover interpretable latent structures of the data
•	Trained the Lasso-Cox Proportional Hazards model and XGBoost-Accelerated Failure Time model to measure the contributions of factors towards increasing or decreasing risk and to model complex feature interactions

## Software
R - 4.2.2
